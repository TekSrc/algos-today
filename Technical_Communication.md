1. Two Number Sum

- The first option is to use a loop inside a nested loop, because the outter loop would carry the first number, the inner loop going through each other number and comparing it to that first number and if added equalling the target number sum, we know. Though this requires less space, it definitely requires more time. Therefore a hashmap is a better solution. We store a hash table of the nums initialized as empty, then utilize are target num sum int subtracting the current number, if the difference does not exist in the hash table, we store it in the table with a bool of true, if we reach a number that does equate after existence, then we simple return the array with those two numbers in it. This is more space storage because of the hashmap, but it's faster at O(n) and therefore I consider it a better solution, though i would naturally lean towards the first.
